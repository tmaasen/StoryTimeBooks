Process for creating new db tables:
1. Make the Model first
	"php artisan make:model NAME -m"
	The '-m' makes the migration along with the model
	when it runs

2. Code in the migration file like we have before to make
the columns
NOTES: 
- The code '$table->timestamps()' auto creates two columns
  on the end of your table: created_at and updated_at that are
  just used as timestamp columns for documenting when a change 
  occurred. Think about if you need this in your column
- Don't create a foreign key before creating the table that
the foreign key is referencing. It matters because of the order 
of the migration to occur. If my migration file has a FK to 
another migration that was created after I made the FK, it will
error when I try to run the migration because of the order I
made my creations.

3. Look to see if you need to do anything in the Model file
before migrating

4. php artisan migrate
NOTE: If you ever have to make a change after a migration has
occurred, either rollback the migration (see documentation) or
make a new migration just for the change (see documentation)
