# Database-Systems
Database class at College of the Ozarks, Spring 2020 semester

The purpose of this project was to create a database-driven application that was an e-commerce bookstore. We were free to choose how we carried out the process.

Our team developed a web application using PHP's Laravel and Vue.js, with a MySQL database hosted on AWS. 

The finished project is also hosted on AWS. Visit our site here: http://storytimebooks.cberkstresser.name/
